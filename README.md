# Deep-Learning-API

These are some common APIs for deep learning, including those that list all the data and those that draw loss and accuracy.

| Number | Function | Detail |
| ---         |     ---      |          --- |
| 01 | [deep_learning_helper_function_generic](https://github.com/chioujryu/Deep-Learning-API/blob/main/deep_learning_helper_functions_generic.py)     | This is a versatile API for deep learning, which is not limited to TensorFlow or PyTorch. |
| 02 | [deep_learning_helper_function_tensorflow](https://github.com/chioujryu/Deep-Learning-API/blob/main/deep_learning_helper_functions_tensorflow.py) | This is a common TensorFlow API. |
| 03 | deep_learning_helper_function_pytorch | This is a common Pytorch API. |
